Well this is an effort to visualise the GLIDE data set.
It requires Django 1.3
If you have Django 1.3 it makes use of an SQL database
things to note, the sqlite file attached is not a spatiallite file. Moved to postgis since my linux is missing pysqlite 2.5+. In the event you have this, you need to sync db..
